Purpose and Goals
The primary goal of this application is to make learning interactive and fun. It offers a platform where users can challenge themselves with quizzes on a variety of topics. Whether it's general knowledge, history, science, or entertainment, this quiz application provides an engaging way for users to explore and test their expertise.

The quiz interface is sleek, responsive, and highly interactive. Using CSS, the layout has been designed to be clean and visually appealing. The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.

2. Question and Answer Functionality
The application dynamically displays quiz questions with multiple-choice answers. Each question is presented one at a time, and users can select their preferred answer. This ensures a focused and clutter-free experience.

3. Score Tracking
After answering each question, the application keeps track of the user’s score. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed, giving users an instant summary of their performance.

4. Timer Functionality
To add an element of challenge, the quiz includes an optional timer for each question. Users must think and respond within the given time limit, adding excitement and a sense of urgency to the experience.

5. Feedback System
The application provides immediate feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect. This feature helps users learn as they play and improves the overall educational value of the quiz.

6. Customization Options
The quiz topics, questions, and answers can be easily updated or customized by modifying the underlying JavaScript code or external data files (such as JSON). This flexibility allows the application to cater to a wide range of audiences and purposes.

Technologies Used
HTML
HTML provides the structure for the quiz application. Key elements such as the question display, answer options, and buttons for navigation (e.g., "Next Question") are implemented using semantic HTML tags.

CSS
CSS is used to style the quiz interface, making it visually appealing. Features such as animations, hover effects, and transitions are implemented to enhance the user experience. The layout is responsive, ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes.
